# Javascript To-Do List Program

## Overview

This project is a to-do list application created to practice and improve my JavaScript skills. The goal was to build a functional, interactive app that uses JavaScript for dynamic behavior and local storage for data persistence. This project helped me understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS, as well as how to handle user input, manipulate the DOM, and store data.

The purpose of this software is to provide a simple, user-friendly to-do list where users can add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed. Itâ€™s a hands-on way to explore key concepts in JavaScript while creating something useful.

## Development Environment

I used the following tools to develop the software:  
- **Visual Studio Code** for writing and testing the code  
- **Google Chrome** for testing and debugging in the browser  
- **Local Storage** for saving user data persistently  

The project was written entirely in **JavaScript**, with basic **HTML** for the structure and **CSS** for styling. No external libraries were used.

## Future Work

There are a few features and improvements I would like to work on:  
- Add drag-and-drop functionality to reorder tasks  
- Implement task categories or tags for better organization  
- Improve accessibility and make the app mobile-friendly  
- Add the ability to set reminders for tasks
